# Automation

***I created automation scripts in Java using Visual Studio Code and WebDriverIO.***

**First Test**
>Emag Test


The first test I created accesses the eMAG.ro site, accesses the "Resealed" page and checks if the correct page is loading.


---------------------

**Second Test**

>Libris Test

In this test I tested the login functionality with the correct user and password as well as with the wrong user and password.
Searching for a specific product, adding it to the wish list and checking if it is the desired product is in the list.
